{Meta / Process} - Documentation for Scuttlebutt
================================================

This repository will contain work in progress documents & notes for my research on **{Meta / Process} Documentation for SSB Projects**.

## Overview

In May 2018 I received a grant from the Scuttlebutt community as part of their ongoing [#SSBC-Grants Program](https://github.com/ssbc/grants-process) to support this research, and synthesise my findings into a series of suggestions / guidelines for the community on how to better improve the visibility of all the wonderful work being done within the Scuttleverse.

The initial proposal can be found [here](proposal.md) on github, or alongside comments & feedback from the community as the initial [Scuttlebutt thread](https://viewer.scuttlebot.io/%25pQsAJUruiVGvktcscF0xOi6eOd0TTtTkbqo%2FegbMH0M%3D.sha256).

## Dev-Diary

Weekly updates will be published as a dev-diary both in this [repository](dev-diary.md), as well as on the corresponding Scuttlebutt [thread](https://viewer.scuttlebot.io/%25IBIWk2HtyLvRYBur5JNBTA9KqRfTgL%2FGEDq%2F%2FzDrPTA%3D.sha256)

## Roadmap

Below is an outline of a proposed rough timeline for the project, and major milestones.
