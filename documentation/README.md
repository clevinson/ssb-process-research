Documentation Structure -- Outline
==================================

This folder ([github](https://github.com/clevinson/ssb-process-research/blob/master/documentation) | [git-ssb](http://localhost:7718/%25Da%2Bmoxvfbbz7u4cSfEjNsR8MakEpCHdJGydPyTfdutA%3D.sha256/tree/master/documentation)) will be where I post work-in-progress documtation for my ongoing #ssb-process-research project. It will start as its own set of documents, but later hopefully get merged into existing documentation (ssb-handbook, etc.)

## Outline

Some thoughts on structure:

- Meta Philosophy
  - This is a set of documents generated from observed behavior (by @corlock) in the scuttlebutt community at a certain point in time (Summer 2018), and is not meant to be dogmatic as to how things go in the scuttleverse
- SSB process philosophy
  - similar format / structure to [Principles page](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/principles.html)
  - content more similar to / inspired by:
    - Mix's comment about "MORE ECOSYSTEM PLAYS"
      - => %WD0M2ulc8tEPdEScbjv3f8X8XAaQ0EA70qdBRzMjVvc=.sha256
    - @andrestaltz's post about "Human Pyramid Towards the Sun"
      - => %AoPzclrGeM7AqLW3nTqJPOZWVfA69/Ns/5MoT6T3KQs=.sha256
    - Richard's "Vibe Theory of Organizational Design"
      - => %08/VhECVICURMnSVJ64pW45Ir+0cH3zEOhCqCsThp68=.sha256
- taxonomy for SSB projects
  - **Question:** What kinds of projects are there in the scuttleverse? How do we categorize them?
  - **Examples:**
    - Large projects
    - small projects
    - modules / libraries
    - plugins
    - tasks
- For a given project type, how do people tend to manage process?
  - best practicies for tagging of project-relevant ssb threads
- SSB Funding sources
  - how money comes in & goes out of the ssb ecosystem?
  - 
- Show me the docs!
  - Dictionary of as many SSB related projects as possible with links to:
    - git-ssb/github repos
    - Status of project. Enum of: [idea, pre-alpha, alpha, beta, live]
    - Issue tracker / project mgmt link
    - ssb tag/channel for conversations
    - relevant SSB Threads

## Questions

- is there a need / desire for viewing high level roadmaps of larger projects in a single place?
- how would one go about coordinating those efforts so that people who want to document a project's roadmap / major milestones:
  - can do it consistently if they'd like
  - can do it their own way, and still link to it from somewhere that people will check
  - can choose not to do document it at all
- Should there be some kind of "collective knowledge-tree/mind-map of ssb threads" that maps btw useful threads and related projects for archiving purposes?
