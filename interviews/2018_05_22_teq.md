> Interview notes with Teq.

## Background / Intros

*   Teq started being on SSB around January 2018
    *   Not a programmer, but interested in the way technologies are used in social spaces
    *   Got involed through (Jade / Craig ?)
    *   they were encouranged as a disabled / genderqueer person to start exploring the space
    *   got interested in moderation issues within SSB
*   Was hanging out for a while & enjoying the space, people were nice

## The Reality / Today (Listening)

*   they pay attention to some projects more than others
*   Private groups is a good one, they've been wanting to follow
    *   Sometimes the discussion goes more technical than their ability, but that's quite fine
    *   They don't ask too many questions, but may end up asking questions soon
*   If there's a new project popping up, they may take a note of it, and try to pay attention
*   Not super fussed to know whats going on all the time, everywhere
*   Part of the decentralized-ness, is that you're kind of "comfortable in not knowing"
*   They pick up particular words & phrases, and then they have a personal excel spreadsheet for
*   Follow channels
*   Dev-diaries are really useful
*   Will follow specific people that are involved in a project
    *   "If I haven't seen something in a while, I will check that person's individual feed to see if there are any updates"
*   If you go to an old one you knew about, you can often find new threads that referenced the old one
*   Uses Grounded Theory methodology for "textual analysis"
    *   Does conceptual summaries every once in a while
        *   "What does the like button do" conceptually
        *   "Future of communities"
        *   Concept of the scuttleverse, what does it actually mean

## The Dream (Listening)

*   Came in initially, and would have loved a glossary
    *   But actually, we're a little too early to say what those concepts are
    *   "I like the looseness around some of these terms"
*   In terms of documentation
    *   There's some documentation on github, some on scuttlebutt website
        *   Not always consistent
    *   Maybe encourage people to document and talk about what these "documentation gardners" are, and what they do
    *   Would be great to say:
        *   Here's the documentation that's happening
        *   Here's the ways you can get involved iwth it
        *   Here's the ways you can start doing new documentation as well
*   Helping devs
    *   MMT is a good example, having a good channel and having it documented
    *   When MMT is very good & explicit in how they work & documentation, Teq is able to sit back and not actively dig in as much
    *   What effort is involved in being consistent ?
        *   Some people have an idea, and don't have the best way to tag it to historical discussions

## Process Structure

*   There's room for taking advantage of the fact that people work in different ways
    *   Someone like Teq who works well in pulling together threads
    *   They could team up and maybe work with a developer in doing that
    *   But some people wouldn't like another person doing their documentation
*   Alternatively:
    *   If there's a way to encourage practices, the only real way of doing that is ppl model it
    *   You get the main contributors to start modeling that behavior and then others pick it up
*   Process Etiquete
    *   Best practices for how people work & document processes
    *   Website was the first point of entry
        *   Teq did a lot of tracing back when they first started
            *   Dan & Mix were people who Teq adopted their practices
    *   Managing expectations for new users in super important
        *   If people come in and are expecting a shiny thing with no bugs, then they're going to get frustrated
    *   Until moderation features are on, they wouldn't invite their friends
*   Story:
    *   There was one situation where they felt they overstepped a boundary, entering into a private conversation in a public space
    *   Like any social space: you have to etiquette guidelines the rules of that space
        *   You can't necessarily expect someone to hold your hand in that process
        *   Linking back was something that they got from Dan
*   Relating to project managment & timeliens
    *   Being able to see what's already happened in relation to what's planned is super useful
    *   It's a bit of a learning experience to not have that
    *   Mix tried to instage these tech trees which were super interesting, but i dont think they kept up
    *   Dominic has a thread, and will update it when those projects update
        *   That's a bit about project-level dependencies
        *   When someone says "whats happening for private groups" you have a good answer

## Goals

An interesting question that came up in discussion:

Given that consistent documentation / process is more of a "nice to have" rather than a "necessity" within the ssb community...
- what should be the actual goals of this kind of documentation?
- how does one measure the success of this kind of work?

We then went through an exercise of brainstorming answers to the above questions.

*   Making it so people don't ask a question that's already been asked
*   It contributes to #community-gardening
    *   It's a shared space, and while it's not somethign thats 100% connected, you're interacting with a shared space and you want it to be enjoyable for the people involved
    *   Better futures projects
        *   By documenting & linking stuff together, the goal is to support the projects
        *   It links "better futures projects" together, and gives other people an access point to know what's going on without having to ask the questions of hte developers necessarily
        *   We're all working towards better futures
        *   It's not just technology, it's a social process
        *   My goal is to be part of linking those areas together
        *   I'm interested in relationship between open science movement and open source movement
        *   How people engage with funding, is super interesting
*   To make it actually impact the world
    *   Lot of work on cooperatives & workers coops, and the idea that ssb provides:
        *   Not just a tool, but a space enact change in the world
        *   Has an ability to connect people who are interested in making the world a better place
*   Personally: a goal is- I engage in that space with the hope of contributing to the larger thing in some way

One last item of discussion was the old threads of tech-trees / dependency trees that Dominic and a few others have shared for some larger protocol / development projects.

These are particularly useful as persistant community artifacts (if kept up to date), but neither of us were sure how regularly they are updated.

*   Are they standardized ?
*   Where do they live (ssb / github / etc)
*   How are they made visible on hte main website / in what context ?
