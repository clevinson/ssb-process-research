## Initial Notes / Quotes
- "i'm super into visibility as a hack"
  - My thoughts: _what are "low cost" ways that we can create visibility of what's going on in the ssb ecosystem?_
- "even if you don't come up with a solution, if you know htat person X feels something and person Y feels something different, that's really good to know!" 

## The reality

### Mix's dev work

- most of my work goes into developing patchbay
  - it was originally dominic's project, mix took over maintenance of it and led a big refactor
  - running an experiment seeing if it was possible to make a toolkit for building other apps more easily
  - deliberately building two different clients, but trying to use the same infrastructure
- ticktack is built on the same foundations of patchbay (using patchcore)
- other thing that mix is building is scuttlepoll (piet & mix got this grant for ssb-loomio)
- got a grant on supporting people's learning
- patchcore has been a really good first pass, but it got some things not perfect, and is a little monolithic
  - mix is leading a push to make tools that can be used in any client
  - you give it an sbot server, and it gives you a bunch of helper functions
- supporting josiah to do scuttle-tag

### What lenses do i have?

- i have some lenses that are technical
- whenever something can be added to patchcore, i'm asking "could this be added to more of a standalone module"
- how do you know what it is, when it is coming out.. etc
- once every 8-12 months there's a "what are we doing" thing that percolates to the surface
  - there's not 1 canonical strategy of what we're doing
  - each person has their own understanding of the future strategy, and thefore they have a tech tree
  - Dominic made a tech tree, but Andre has a tech tree as well (which is pushing towards mobile)
  - Now we have both of those trees, so we can look at them and talk about them
- mix has pretty good (early) view into infrastructure projects (like EBT)
  - talks to dominic quite regularly, so has been hearing about EBT in person from dominic for ages
  - as mix is trying to build ticktack, he's come back to the question of "we're being paid to do open source work.. would now be a good time to do a dedicated push on EBT to get it out there and tested?"
    - launching pubs that are using it
    - would it help with reliability & speed thigns up ?

### The contributor perspective

- because ssb is open source, this is done with people's love & spare time
- dates for roadmaps & deliverables can feel antithetical to that
- imagine Andre said "i'm launching mobile in July, are you all with me? i'm gunna need lots of support"
  - then maybe people would try and commit to a timeframe
- timelines are not very useful with the above in mind
- for Roadmaps... supporting things like tech trees, and periodically post up & revisit tech trees
- i like making Repos which are maps of the domain
- the scuttlebutt guide which points to other repos as learning repos
- similarly.. starting meta threads in scuttlebutt is a good way to do documentation
  - dev diaries
  - funding grants

#### Where does information live?

- mix was pretty keen for dogfooding on scuttlebutt
- bc of that, IRC is not really active
- on github you have issues..
- there will also be some private conversations that you cannot see on scuttlebutt
- sometimes it's coordinating parts of a project (ticktack)
- there is a trello board for [scuttle-poll](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttle-poll)
- dominic is a prolific writer of code, so his github notification inbox situation is quite overwhelming
- there's a lot of excitement (from @dominic) for @dinosaur & @mixmix to work on issue tracker stuff
  - open / closed is a really shallow marking system
  - the question is more "is any action needed on this"

#### Some information gets duplicated / left out / forked

- there may be multiple channels (on ssb) where stuff lives.. someone accidentally winds another person up, or forks a repo and now two repos being maintained
  - conversations happen either in person or on calls... where poeple are resolving differences. but these in person comms build trust & coherance
- "i watch out for the devs that i know, i'm accutely aware that there's a lot of devs that haven't had a chance to interact with me"
  - may situations like "Dev X sounds like a great human being", but mix doesn't have the opportunity to be there and develop relationships with everyone

#### Personal interactions matter!

- it's really important for people to have a beer, share a laugh or something
- you will have a better chance at having enough trust to not take something as a personal attack
- it might be quite a good idea to see how we could support more ideas & more conversation
- "i feel like the interpersonal conversations & support are quite a big part of how things get done"
- "if i get blocked, i can hit up a more senior dev and they are very supportive, and that is off the back of our good relationships"
- it's a direct reflection of prolific developers' painful github notificaiton situation
  - "github" as software is built so that he doesn't have to talk to as many people

#### What about newcomers... 

- scuttlebutt is a sociotechnical project & space
- there's the github repos, but its as much about hte people & relationships being maintained and hte conversations that are happening between them
- if i was a new person here, or to advise a new person here.. how do i get looped in?
  - join some conversations on scuttlebutt (maybe #somebodyshould !)
  - people notice that... that a person is being thoughtful
  - ideally they're not just asking me to solve bugs
  - if i can solve a bug that will help them out, then maybe they will help out more

#### Moon Apps vs Sun Apps

- github is masculine vibe, sun app
- where as..
  - let's go fishing / play a game of chess & toss some ideas
  - have a thread for dreaming about hte future... maybe have a laugh
  - this is more of a moon app
  - it's like going out to lunch... wha'ts the point of going out to lunch? it doesn't fit on a roadmap, but it's a different thign


#### People asking the same questions again and again

- It's a little bit upsetting that there are all these legacy sites that are still there
- mix: i appreciate that you notice this as a dynamic (ppl asking for private groups again and again)
- death by a thousand papercuts (it's such a minor thing to ask something)
  - you don't want to be unreasonalbe, but you also... 
  - the gotcha is that to avoid death by a thousand papercuts, you need to invest time & energy in some form to make something that is more structured
  - but i dont know what form that should take
- the ideal longterm solutions
  - community village app.. the evolution of issues (something that is more conversational)
    - that would just work!
  - in the meantime.. i would be tempted to maybe every month it would be amazing if there was one person who made a snapshot of the state of progress of known big pieces and listens for what are the common painpoints
  - saying things like:
    - "editing" keeps coming up and its not on the roadmap right now
    - mobile is up & running, in progress, here's the repos, etc. etc.
  - this could just be a hackMD or a repo
  - this could be an interesting thing to swarm on in a call
  - every two months let's get on a call and avoid the Death by FAQ
