> Interview notes with Isthisa.

## Background / Intros

- heard about scuttlebutt initially from an article from a friend (ages ago)
- later, heard more about it at CCC this year
- working already in the decentralized tech space (pretty focused on blockchains)
- wanted to explore other aspects of the p2p world
  - ssb seemed like a good place to start
  - people described it as "like a blockchain but without consensus"
- experiences thus far are primarily as a user
  - "I do a lot of Node, so it seems like the stack is approachable"
- spent a lot of time on scuttlebutt.nz and read through getting started
  - using patchwork as a client
  - there was a while week wehre Patchwork wouldn't open.. couldn't find crash reports, couldn't send in an issue
    - patchwork might have been filling up a tmp folder... 

## The Reality / Today (Listening)

- my very first moments on SSB were on riat chat, exchanging keys with local meshnet groups
- then did the same with a cryptocurrency slack community
- started following people through threads to try and find information
  - wouldn't really know how this stuff actually works
- it definitely seems like a lot of ppl on SSB are talking about:
  - governane of the protocol
  - dev stuff related to the protocol
  - it's not super clear what people actually do...
    - but clearly there's a lot of knowledge, and somebody has a clear understanding of that
  - haven't spent a lot of time lurking ssb on github
    - wouldn't really know where to start if i were to dig into github
- even the differentiation between protocol & clients was not really clear
- another thing that was a big initial misconception was pubs
  - didn't initially understand that pubs were "just friends"
- if i had a question... i would just google it
  - googling of things, usually just leads to the getting started guide
  - main source of documentation has been the gitbook and the getting started guide
- haven't gotten to the point where i have a Q and "ask a Q on ssb"
  - me and some friends were first wanting to ask some questions
    - same keys different devices
      - found a thread where someone said "we're working on this feature, and it will be ready by date X" but date X has already passed...
- there's an amazing sense of community
- i feel very welcome, even though i haven't interacted with a whole lot of people
- some folks are offering their home for scuttlebutters... but that won't scale
- culture of dogfooding is great, but..
  - if i were going to contribute to an open source project, and i knew what i wanted to do
  - the github model of OSS contribution is the one that i'm familiar with
  - i'm not sure how i would navigate within the scuttlebutt ecosystem itself to find something to get started on


### An example project idea Isthisa had..
- maybe making a IFTT style thing, that takes my twitter posts and puts them on scuttlebutt (or selectively does that)
- that's a fun, self contained project
  - i would learn more about ssb, but it wouldn't require interfacing too directly with the community
- but where would I actaully go to start figuring out how to build such a thing?

## The Dream (Listening)

- is scuttlebutt / the scuttlebutt community ready to massively onboard new contributors ?
  - the proccess being described "do wahtever you want! find something to do and just do it!" is common in very small & young projects
    - problems may arise when you lose a coherant sense of vision
    - if ssb wanted to grow its contributors, then "get started with contributing" would be really useful (note: this exists, but is not super clear how to actually get involved)
  - the first question should be **"are we ready to onboard more devs?"**
- there's been some issues around "tourists on ssb", so if that's a problem, maybe you don't even want a lot of new contributors


## Process Structure

- coming from Ethereum...
  - it used to be so wrong, that it was incredibly frustrating
  - if you tried to follow a tutorial that was on the ethereum foundations website, it was probably incorrect / out of date
- informally, most of the discussions were happening on stack overflow posts (similar to SSB)
  - there is a danger of documentation:
    - **wrong documentation is worse than no documentation**
  - with new communities that aren't ready to maintain that, it can be a problem
- mapping all the projects that are going on tangentially to scuttlebutt would be really cool
- "knowing what we're even doing" is actually very difficult (from Isthisa's own projects)
  - has the left hand & right hand solved the same thing in different ways... probably!
- "i think a lot about decentralization in general, and trade-offs / benefits"
  - in decentralized systems, they duplicate effort (are not as efficient)
  - quite funny that on a human level, decentralized organizations end up duplicating labor
- "i'm picturing something really visual... of the projects in the scuttleverse, that would be really cool"
  - we have something like that for our company, it circles in different teams and shows the different stuff being worked on
- **wherever this thing lives, and however people interface with it... it would be great if people don't have to leave platforms they're comfortable with in order to update it**
  - what if the map actually listens to a tag on SSB ?
  - people can update it using SSB in some way ?
