## Background

- Nadia wrote [roads and bridges](https://www.fordfoundation.org/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure) as part of a research project funded by Ford Foundation
- her work involves researching the financial sustainability of open source infrastructure
- while her research focus is slightly different from the one I am taking for this project*, I wanted to speak with her to see what learnings could be had from her work on other open source projects

*scuttlebutt is not "infrastructure" in the way Nadia focuses on it, and my focus is more on development processes and less on financial stability

Below are some initial notes from her view of the landscape today:

- when it comes to how projects think about development and funding of their work, there's a weird dividing line between projects that have some cryptocurrency play, and ones that don't
  - most "crypto" open source projects, are structuring themselves much more like a company than open source projects that don't have any single "funding model"
  - this is because crypto projects have an assumed pool of capital to pay people with
- ssb is not crypto, but crypto adjacent (in the p2p space)
  - one of ssb's unique principles is that there seem to be multiple pools of capital that can be used to pay & fund people's work
- people raise money on opencollective, but don't really know what to do with it
  - it usually seems like an awkwardly low amount of money to come in...
  - this is definitely true for ssb (still no exact plan of how to use the opencollective funds)

## How projects organize

### Some initial Q's (from me)

- how do you see projects organizing their work ?
  - of different sizes?
  - how does a project go from 5 devs & community, to 10, 20 devs?
- how do maintainers feel about process ?
  - managing through github
  - any kind of roadmap planning / project management ?

### Nadia's thoughts

- it's pretty rare for people to do any code planning...
  - some people do weekly calls that are public (people can join in on those)
    - someone might document the notes for that meeting and put it in a repo
    - for bigger projects there's a bigger repo called "meeting notes"
  - mailing list archives
  - people are trying to keep more and more stuff on github for different repos
  - lots of discussions happen on "discourse"
    - this is separate from the issue
- usually a welcome repo is a good thing to have
  - giving people a self landing page
  - would be good to have a contributing page
  - make an FAQ and start
  - someone has to take responsibility of keeping FAQ and contributing and stuff up to doate
- some projects use wiki's
  - as the community grows, they can get spammy
  - eventually everything gets bigger, and gnarlier to maintain
  - if you have someone who is focused on just maintaining that, then that's great. otherwise it's very difficult
- some use project mgmt tools
  - waffle.io, zenhub... (jira is a little too heavy..)
- some projects separate out into many repos
  - usually some main repo that most folks gravitate towards
  - following that readme, etc.
  - wherever people come in first.. maybe it's the website, in which case that is a good destinations
- some projects are mono-repos
  - this makes things a lot easier to manage thing through an issue trackers

### org structure

- node school / django girls
  - someone started a nodeschool website, now they have chapters, etc. where people say "i want to make my own version, etc. etc."
  - formalizing as an org with chapters springs up when there's a desire to meet physically (or accept funds from different locations)
- people usually have a foundation that is US based

## Larger example Projects

- Hommebrew
  - a single lead maintainer + 10 other maintianers
- git
  - gitmerge conference every year
  - software freedom conservancy
- webtorrent (feross)
  - also a user facing project
  - opened a thread "if you're a company that benefits from this, self identify and maybe give us some money"
