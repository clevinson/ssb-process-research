SSB Process Interviews
======================


This folder ([github](https://github.com/clevinson/ssb-process-research/blob/master/interviews) | [git-ssb](http://localhost:7718/%25Da%2Bmoxvfbbz7u4cSfEjNsR8MakEpCHdJGydPyTfdutA%3D.sha256/tree/master/interviews)) is where i'll be collecting notes from my research interviews.

Below, I outline a loose guide for how I plan to structure interviews with community members to better understand people's thoguhts & wildest dreams w/r/t documentation & visibility of SSB projects.

## Interview Structure


I'm looking to speak to a diverse range of:
- new community members
- infrequent contributors
- folx from underrepresented groups within ssb (women/trans/POC)
- core contributors
- grant receivers
- active community members who aren't coders

## Goals

Over the course of these interviews, I'm hoping to get a sense of what kind of views people within the ssb community hold w/r/t process & visibility of work being done within the ssb ecosystem.

I will be documenting my anonymized findings on github, and later compile them into a structured report that I will present back to the scuttlebutt community. After sharing, the report will be used as the basis for a series of suggestions for process guidelines.

## Questions

### The Reality (listener)
- Do you think that you have a good sense of the major projects going on in the Scuttlbutt ecosystem?
  - Why or why not?
- How do you keep up to date on what's going on in the broader Scuttlebutt ecosystem?
- How many individual projects do you try to actively follow?
- For the projects you care about following, how do you stay updated on their progress?
  - What do / don't you like about that?

### The Reality (contributor)

- how many projects are you contributing to / maintaining in the Scuttlebutt ecosystem?
- how do you plan your work for projects you contribute to?
- how do you plan your work for projects you maintain / are a core contributor of?

### The Dream

- what would be your ideal scenario for consuming information about major technical developments / milestones in the scuttlebutt ecosystem?
- what would be your ideal way to define / manage roadmaps and external communication for projects within ssb ?

### Process Structure

- How much process is too much process?
- When there is standardized guidelines for process, what should those guidelines look like?
- What level of guidelines do you think should be provided when it comes to streamlinig processes for SSB projects?
  - this could include:
    - syncronization btw github/git-ssb
    - consistent project-based ssb channel for tracking ssb-threads related to a project
    - owner of a project defines how they expose timelines / roadmap, but there's a consistent way for them to document that in some meta-documentation in ssb-handbook ?
