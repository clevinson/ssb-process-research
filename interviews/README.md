SSB Interview Structure
=======================


This folder ([github](https://github.com/clevinson/ssb-process-research/blob/master/) serves as a guide for how I plan to structure interviews with community members to better understand people's conceptions of SSB process.

## Goals

Over the course of these interviews, I'm hoping to get a sense of what kind of views people within the ssb community hold w/r/t process and the like.

This includes:
- How much process is too much process?
- When there is process, what should it look like?

## Ideas for questions

Some basic ideas for questions & groups of them..

- Do you think that you have a good sense of the major projects going on in Scuttlbutt ?
- Do you wish that you knew more ?
- How do you keep up to date on what's going on in the development ecosystem?
- For the projects you care about following, how do you stay updated on their progress?
  - What do / don't you like about that?
- What level of guidelines do you think should be provided when it comes to streamlinig processes for SSB projects?
  - this could include:
    - syncronization btw github/git-ssb
    - consistent ssb hashtag / channel for tracking ssb-threads related to this project
    - owner of a project defines how they expose timelines / roadmap, but there's a consistent way for them to document that in some meta-documentation in ssb-handbook ?
