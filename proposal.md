[May Grant Proposal] {Meta / Process} Documentation for SSB Projects
====================================================================

Hey all.. there's been a number of developments that has led me to believe that the #scuttleverse could benefit from more documentation on things around process, and the development roadmaps of the many projects in the ecosystem. Some could call this "project management", but I worry that this term implies too much the setting and enforcing of rules, which is **not** at all what I would intend to do with this proposal. Here i'm going to outline a bit more detail about my observations in the scuttleverse over the past few months, along with a proposal that I'd like to solicit feedback from the larger #scuttlebutt community on.

### Some observations

There's a bunch of amazing, talented, self-initiating people within the scuttlebutt ecosystem. Lots of people have ideas & opinions about a number of things with respect to the larger #scuttleverse in terms of how things should get done.

There is not a great method of retaining institutional memory for discussions that happen within the scuttlebutt ecosystem. I've seen many threads come and go asking similar questions, and someone luckily will read it, remember that there was a similar discussion several months ago, and link to the corresponding thread.

There are a number of projects that I'm following development on, but for each project I've had to piece difference sources of information together myself.


For example:
- larger projects like #patchwork or #mmmmm I can view in their channels to get an overview of what's up. These projects also have a lot of github activity and some progress can be viewed in the milestones section
- #ssbc-grants projects i can go to the hackMD doc to find the grants, and then look for their dev-diaries in the dev-diary meta thread
- mobile-ssb-quests don't have defined way to document their process / completion (that I've been able to find!)

What I want to have is a single place that points to ongoing projects on the ssb ecosystem, and lists out where one can find more information on them (github wikis, ssb threads, etc.)

### The Proposal

The above gives a flavor for one "desire" that I have. However, this proposal isn't (only) about me  :grinning:

In fact, it's mostly about all of you! The rest of the SSB ecosystem.

I've identified above some example pain points that I've personally found when it comes to staying up to date with what's going on in the #scuttleverse, but the main focus of this proposal would be conducting a series of personal interviews / vid-chats with folks throughout the ssb ecosystem so I can understand what potential pain points they feel are most severe when it comes to documentation.

Of course I want to make my cute little git page indexing a bunch of projects & links to their resources, but more importantly, I want to document and summarize (either anonymously or with authorship when consented) the feelings of many different actors in the community when it comes to what's going well w/r/t documentation.

Ideally, I would like to get input from:
- as many core contributors of scuttlebutt as possible
- folks who have worked on projects within the #ssbc-grants or #mobile-ssb-quests ecosystems
- people who are more quiet and usually only reading / commenting on things in the scuttleverse
- friends of scuttlebutters who have looked at the project but maybe ran away because things were too confusing or scary

The first deliverable for this proposal would be to share & document all my findings from interviews, and then propose a series of suggestions / open guidelines for feedback to the community. If these guidelines were accepted, I would do as much heavy lifting as possible to implement any of the proposals myself, and seek out ways for them to be carried forward after getting things initially setup.

Looking forward to hearing feedback / suggestions. I have lots of specific ideas of ways to enhance documentation of projects & their ongoing statuses.. but I really wanted to make this proposal community first, by starting with interviews and then guidelines, and seeing what commonalities arise naturally from people's desires in this space.
