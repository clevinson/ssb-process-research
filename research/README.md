Research
========

This folder will be where I'm keeping track of notes / raw research materials that may or may not make their way into "Documentation" as an official output of the project. The contents of this folder are mostly for my own sanity and note-taking, and I do not have an explicit goal for these notes to be readable / understandable by all who come across them :)

  - a list of interesting ssb threads of technical documentation / specific how-to's for certain projects or tasks
  - this will only really be useful if I end up trying to compile mind-map style relationships between ssb projects & relavant threads for them
